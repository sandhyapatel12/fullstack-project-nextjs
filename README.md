-->  In this project used next js version 15 and  next-auth doesnâ€™t yet support React 19, so downgrading React to a compatible version (like 18.2.0) can resolve the conflict:

`npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0`

npm install @types/recharts

npm install moment  -->    `for display date in table`



-> main light color `#6aa84f`
-> main dark color  `#38761d`
